<!-- this snippet  has one category or HTML for just one category.
And the reason that is, is because as we get an array of these categories or array of objects from (https://coursera-jhu-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/categories.json),
we're going to loop over that array and every time we get a category with
this information, we're going to want to populate this little snippet and
then make a copy of it and then insert it and keep building up our HTML.
So this is what the snippet is about.
This is really something that is more like a template.  -->

<!-- and in the json object from above link we have one property/key called "short_name" and also have "name" property/key , so we take that key and put its value in above html -->

<!-- like images/L/L.jpg  -->   
<!-- here L is short_name value which is a folder actually in our structure -->
